      "##4000161 Section : Life and Letters <p> I do n't remember hearing the phrase \" white guilt \" very much before the mid-1960s . Growing up black in the 1950s , I never had the impression that whites were much disturbed by guilt when it came to blacks . When I would stray into the wrong restaurant in pursuit of a hamburger , it did n't occur to me that the waitress was unduly troubled by guilt when she asked me to leave . I can see now that possibly she was , but then all I saw was her irritability at having to carry out so unpleasant a task . If there was guilt , it was mine for having made an imposition of myself . I can remember feeling a certain sympathy for such people , as if I was victimizing them by drawing them out of an innocent anonymity into the unasked for role of racial policemen . Occasionally they came right out and asked me to feel sorry for them . A caddymaster at a country club told my brother and me that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this white club and that we should try to understand his position , \" put yourselves in my shoes . \" Our color had brought this man anguish and , if a part of that anguish was guilt , it was not as immediate to me as my own guilt . I smiled at the man to let him know he should n't feel bad and then began my long walk home . Certainly I also judge him a coward , but in that era his cowardice was something I had to absorb . <p> In the 1960s , particularly the black-is-beautiful late 1960s , this absorption of another 's cowardice was no longer necessary . The lines of moral power , like plates in the earth , had shifted . White guilt became so palpable you could see it on people . At the time what it looked like to my eyes was a remarkable loss of authority . And what whites lost in authority , blacks gained . You can not feel guilty about anyone without giving away power to them . Suddenly , this huge vulnerability had opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the power to step right into it . In fact , black power all but demanded that you do so . What shocked me in the late 1960s , after the helplessness I had felt in the fifties , was that guilt had changed the nature of the white man 's burden from the administration of inferiors to the uplift of equals -- from the obligations of dominance to the urgencies of repentance . <p> I think what made the difference between the fifties and sixties , at least as far as white guilt was concerned , was that whites underwent an archetypal Fall . Because of the immense turmoil of the civil rights movement , and later the black-power movement , whites were confronted for more than a decade with their willingness to participate in , or comply with , the oppression of blacks , their indifference to human suffering and denigration , their capacity to abide evil for their own benefit and in the defiance of their own sacred principles . The 1964 Civil Rights Bill that bestowed equality under the law on blacks was also , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had white society not been wrong , there would have been no need for such a bill . In this bill the nation acknowledged its fallenness , its lack of racial innocence , and confronted the incriminating self-knowledge that it had rationalized for many years a flagrant injustice . Denial is a common way of handling guilt , but in the 1960s there was little will left for denial except in the most recalcitrant whites . With this defense lost there was really only one road back to innocence -- through actions and policies that would bring redemption . <p> In the 1960s the need for white redemption from racial guilt became the most powerful , yet unspoken , element in America 's social-policy-making process , first giving rise to the Great Society and then to a series of programs , policies , and laws that sought to make black equality and restitution a national mission . Once America could no longer deny its guilt , it went after redemption , or at least the look of redemption , and did so with a vengeance . Yet today , some twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many measures the gap between blacks and whites is widening rather than narrowing . A University of Chicago study indicates that segregation is more entrenched in American cities today than ever imagined . A National Research Council study notes the \" status of blacks relative to whites ( in housing and education ) has stagnated or regressed since the early seventies . \" A follow-up to the famous Kerner Commission Report warns that blacks are as much at risk today of becoming a \" nation within a nation \" as we were twenty years ago , when the original report was made . <p> I think the white need for redemption has contributed to this tragic situation by shaping our policies regarding blacks in ways that may deliver the look of innocence to society and its institutions but that do very little actually to uplift blacks . The specific effect of this hidden need has been to bend social policy more toward reparation for black oppression than toward the much harder and more mundane work of black uplift and development . Rather than facilitate the development of blacks to achieve parity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good example -- have tended to give blacks special entitlements that in many cases are of no use because blacks lack the development that would put us in a position to take advantage of them . I think the reason there has been more entitlement than development is ( along with black power ) the unacknowledged white need for redemption -- not true redemption , which would have concentrated policy on black development , but the appearance of redemption , which requires only that society , in the name of development , seem to be paying back its former victims with preferences . One of the effects of entitlements , I believe , has been to encourage in blacks a dependency both on entitlements and on the white guilt that generates them . Even when it serves ideal justice , bounty from another man 's guilt weakens . While this is not the only factor in black \" stagnation \" and \" regression , \" I believe it is one very potent factor . <p> It is easy enough to say that white guilt too often has the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what exactly is this guilt , and how does it work in American life ? <p> I think white guilt , in its broad sense , springs from a knowledge of ill-gotten advantage . More precisely , it comes from the juxtaposition of this knowledge with the inevitable gratitude one feels for being white rather than black in America . Given the moral instincts of human beings , it is all but impossible to enjoy an ill-gotten advantage , much less to feel at least secretly grateful for it , without consciously or unconsciously experiencing guilt . If , as Kierkegaard writes , \" innocence is ignorance , \" then guilt must always involve knowledge . White Americans know that their historical advantage comes from the subjugation of an entire people . So , even for whites today for whom racism is anathema , there is no escape from the knowledge that makes for guilt . Racial guilt simply accompanies the condition of being white in America . <p> I do not believe that this guilt is a crushing anguish for most whites , but I do believe it constitutes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a thread in white life , sometimes felt , sometimes not , but ever present as a potential feeling . In the late 1960s almost any black could charge this vulnerability with enough current for a white person to feel it . I had a friend who had developed this activity into a sort of specialty . I do n't think he meant to be mean , though certainly he was mean . I think he was , in that hyperbolic era , exhilarated by the discovery that his race , which had long been a liability , now gave him a certain edge -- that white guilt was the true force behind black power . To feel this power he would sometimes set up what he called \" race experiments . \" Once I watched him stop a white businessman in the men 's room of a large hotel and convince him to increase his tip to the black attendant from one to twenty dollars . <p> My friend 's tactic was very simple , even corny . Out of the attendant 's earshot he asked the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly , and very dark man in a starched white smock that made the skin on his neck and face look as leathery as a turtle 's . He sat listlessly , pathetically , on a straight-backed chair next to a small table on which sat a stack of hand towels and a silver plate for tips . Since the attendant offered no service whatever beyond the handing out of towels , one could only conclude the hotel management offered his lowly presence as flattery to their patrons , as an opportunity for that easy noblesse oblige that could reassure even the harried and weary traveling salesman of his superior station . My friend was quick to make this point to the businessman and to say that no white man would do in this job . But when the businessman put the single back in his wallet and took out a five , my friend only sneered . Did he understand the tragedy of a life spent this way , of what it must be like to earn one 's paltry living as a symbol of inferiority ? And did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironically he had just spent the day trying to sell a printing press to the Black Muslims for their newspaper Mohammed Speaks ) was connected to the deprivation of this man and others like him ? <p> But then my friend made a mistake that ended the game . In the heat of argument , which until then had only been playfully challenging , he inadvertently mentioned his father . This stopped the victim cold and his eyes turned inward . \" What about your father ? \" the businessman asked . My friend replied , \" He had a hard life , that 's all . \" \" How did he have a hard life ? \" the businessman asked . Now my friend was on the defensive . I knew he did not get along with his father , a bitter man who worked nights in a factory and demanded that the house be dark and silent all day . My friend blamed his father 's bitterness on racism , but I knew he had not meant to exploit his own pain in this silly \" experiment . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know how to get out of the situation without losing face . Now , caught in his own trap , he did what he least wanted to do . He gave forth the rage he truly felt to a white stranger in a public men 's room . \" My father never had a chance , \" he said with the kind of anger that could easily turn to tears . \" He never had a freakin ' chance . Your father had all the goddamn chances , and you know he did . You sell printing presses to black people and make thousands and your father probably lives down in Fat City , Florida , all because you 're white . \" On and on he went in this vein , using -- against all that was honorable in him -- his own profound racial pain to extract a flash of guilt from a white man he did n't even know . <p> He got more than a flash . The businessman was touched . His eyes became mournful , and finally he simply said , \" You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" He took a twenty dollar bill from his wallet and walked over and dropped it in the old man 's tip plate . When he was gone my friend and I could not look at the old man , nor could we look at each other . <p> It is obvious that this was a rather shameful encounter for all concerned -- my friend and I , as his silent accomplice , trading on our racial pain , tampering with a stranger for no reason , and the stranger then buying his way out of the situation for twenty dollars , a sum that was generous by one count and cheap by another . It was not an encounter of people but of historical grudges and guilts . Yet , when I think about it now twenty years later , I see that it had all the elements of a paradigm that I believe has been very much at the heart of racial policy-making in America since the 1960s . <p> My friend did two things that made this businessman vulnerable to his guilt -- that brought his guilt into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in touch with his own knowledge of his ill-gotten advantage as a white . The effect of this was to disallow the man any pretense of racial innocence , to let him know that , even if he was not the sort of white who used the word nigger around the dinner table , he still had reason to feel racial guilt . But , as disarming as this might have been , it was too abstract to do much more than crack open this man 's vulnerability , to expose him to the logic of white guilt . This was the five-dollar , intellectual sort of guilt . The twenty dollars required something more visceral . In achieving this , the second thing my friend did was something he had not intended to do , something that ultimately brought him as much shame as he was doling out : He made a display of his own racial pain and anger . ( What brought him shame was not the pain and anger , but his trading on them for what turned out to be a mere twenty bucks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's knowledge of ill-gotten advantage , to give credibility and solidity to it by putting a face on it . Here was human testimony , a young black beside himself at the thought of his father 's racially constricted life . The pain of one man evidenced the knowledge of the other . When the businessman listened to my friend 's pain , his racial guilt -- normally only one source of guilt lying dormant among others -- was called out like a neglected debt he would finally have to settle . An ill-gotten advantage is not hard to bear -- it can be marked up to fate -- until it touches the genuine human pain it has brought into the world . This is the pain that hardens guilty knowledge . <p> Such knowledge is a powerful influence when it becomes conscious . What makes it so powerful is the element of fear that guilt always carries , the fear of what the guilty knowledge says about us . Guilt makes us afraid for ourselves , and thus generates as much self-preoccupation as concern for others . The nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reestablishment of good feeling about oneself . <p> In this sense , the fear for the self that is buried in all guilt is a pressure toward selfishness . It can lead us to put our own need for innocence above our concern for the problem that made us feel guilt in the first place . But this fear for the self does not only inspire selfishness ; it also becomes a pressure to escape the guilt-inducing situation . When selfishness and escapism are at work , we are no longer interested in the source of our guilt and , therefore , no longer concerned with an authentic redemption from it . Then we only want the look of redemption , the gesture of concern that will give us the appearance of innocence and escape from the situation . Obviously the businessman did not put twenty dollars in the tip plate because he thought it would uplift black Americans . He did it selfishly for the appearance of concern and for the escape it afforded him . <p> This is not to say that guilt is never the right motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a very dangerous one because of its tendency to draw us into self-preoccupation and escapism . Guilt is a civilizing emotion when the fear for the self that it carries is contained -- a containment that allows guilt to be more selfless and that makes genuine concern possible . I think this was the kind of guilt that , along with the other forces , made the 1964 Civil Rights Bill possible . But since then I believe too many of our social policies related to race have been shaped by the fearful underside of guilt . <p> Black power evoked white guilt and made it a force in American institutions , very much in the same way as my friend brought it to life in the businessman . Few people volunteer for guilt . Usually others make us feel it . It was the expression of black anger and pain that hardened the guilty knowledge of white ill-gotten advantage . And black power -- whether from militant fringe groups , the civil rights establishment , or big city political campaigns -- knew exactly the kind of white guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white guilt in which whites fear for their own decency and innocence ; it wanted the guilt of white self-preoccupation and escapism . Always at the heart of black power , in whatever form , has been a profound anger at what was done to blacks and an equally profound feeling that there should be reparations . But a sober white guilt ( in which fear for the self is still contained ) seeks a strict fairness -- the 1964 Civil Rights Bill that guaranteed equality under the law . It is of little value when one is after more than fairness . So black power made its mission to have whites fear for their innocence , to feel a visceral guilt from which they would have to seek a more profound redemption . In such redemption was the possibility of black reparation . Black power upped the ante on white guilt . <p> With black power , all of the elements of the hidden paradigm that shape America 's race-related social policy were in place . Knowledge of ill-gotten advantage could now be shown and deepened by black power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redeem themselves by offering more than fairness -- by offering forms of reparation and compensation for past injustice . I believe this bent our policies toward racial entitlements at the expense of racial development . In 1964 , one of the assurances Senator Hubert Humphrey and others had to give Congress to get the landmark Civil Rights Bill passed was that the bill would not in any way require employers to use racial preferences to rectify racial imbalances . But this was before the explosion of black power in the late 1960s , before the hidden paradigm was set in motion . After black power , racial preferences became the order of the day . <p> If this paradigm brought blacks entitlements , it also brought the continuation of the most profound problem in American society , the invisibility of blacks as a people . The white guilt that this paradigm elicits is the kind of guilt that preoccupies whites with their own innocence and pressures them toward escapism -- twenty dollars in the plate and out the door . With this guilt , as opposed to the contained guilt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for quick redemption . Blacks then become a means to this redemption and , as such , they must be seen as generally \" less than \" others . Their needs are \" special , \" \" unique , \" \" different . \" They are seen exclusively along the dimension of their victimization , so that they become \" different \" people with whom whites can negotiate entitlements but never fully see as people like themselves . Guilt that preoccupies people with their own innocence blinds them to those who make them feel guilty . This , of course , is not racism , and yet it has the same effect as racism since it makes blacks something of a separate species for whom normal standards and values do not automatically apply . <p> Nowhere is this more evident today than in American universities . At some of America 's most elite universities administrators have granted concessions in response to black student demands ( black power ) that all but sanction racial separatism on campus -- black \" theme \" dorms , black student unions , black yearbooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe administrators sincerely believe in these separatist concessions . Most of them are liberals who see racial separatism as wrong . But black student demands pull administrators into the paradigm of self-preoccupied white guilt , whereby they seek a quick redemption by offering special entitlements that go beyond fairness . As a result , black students become all but invisible to them . Though blacks have the lowest grade point average of any racial group in American universities , administrators never sit down with them and \" demand \" in kind that black students bring their grades up to par . The paradigm of white guilt makes the real problems of black students secondary to the need for white redemption . It also cuts administrators off from their own values , which would most certainly discourage racial separatism and encourage higher academic performance for black students . Lastly , it makes for escapist policies . There is no difference between giving black students a separate lounge and leaving twenty dollars in the tip plate on the way out the door . <p> What demonstrates more than anything else the degree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this paradigm is their refusal to lead black students , to tell them what they honestly think , to insist that they perform at a higher academic level , and to ask them to integrate themselves fully into campus life . This marks the difference between self-preoccupied guilt and the guilt of genuine concern where fear for one 's innocence is contained . The former grants entitlements as a means to easy innocence and escape from judgment ; the latter refuses the entanglements and blindness of self-concerned guilt , and , out of honest concern , demands black development . <p> Escapist racial policies -- policies where institutions favor black entitlement over development because of a preoccupation with their own innocence -- have , I believe , a dispiriting effect on blacks . Such policies have the effect of transforming whites from victimizers into patronizers and keeping blacks where they have always been -- dependent on the largesse of whites . This was made evident in a famous statement by President Lyndon Johnson at Howard University in 1965 . \" You do not take a person who , for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say , You 're free to compete with others , ' and justly believe that you have been fair . \" On its surface this seems to be the most reasonable of statements , but on closer examination one can clearly see how it deflects the emphasis away from black responsibility and toward white responsibility . The actors in this statement -- \" you ( whites ) do not take a person ( blacks ) \" -- are whites ; blacks are the passive recipients of white action . The former victimizers are challenged now to be patrons , but where is the black challenge ? This is really a statement to and about white people , their guilt , their responsibility , and their road to redemption . Not only does it not enunciate a black mission , but it sees blacks only on the dimension of their victimization -- \" hobbled by chains \" -- and casts them once again into the role of receivers of white beneficence . Nowhere in this utterance does President Johnson show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks to run fast once they get to the \" starting line . \" This statement , which launched Johnson 's Great Society , had the two ever-present signposts of white guilt -- white self-preoccupation and black invisibility . <p> White guilt has influenced many of America 's racial policies toward a paternalism that makes it difficult for blacks to find their true mettle or to develop a faith in their own capacity to run as fast as others . The most vivid examples of this are the many forms of preferential treatment that come under the heading of affirmative action -- an escapist racial policy , I believe , that offers entitlements rather than development to blacks . A preference is not a training program ; it teaches no skills , instills no values . It only makes a color a passport . But the worst aspect of racial preferences is that they encourage dependency on entitlements rather than on our own initiative , a situation that has already led many blacks to believe that we can not have fairness without entitlements . Here one falls into Orwellian doublespeak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion , I believe , is an unspoken black doubt about our ability to compete that is covered over by a preoccupation with racial discrimination . Since there are already laws to protect us against discrimination , preferences only impute a certain helplessness to blacks that diminishes our self-esteem . The self-preoccupied form of white guilt that is behind racial preferences always makes us lower so that we can be lifted up . <p> Recently Pennsylvania State University launched a program that pays black students for improving their grades -- a C to C+ average brings $550 , and anything higher brings $1,100 . Here is the sort of guilty kindness that kills . What kind of self-respect is a black student going to have as he or she reaches out to take $550 for C work when many white students would be embarrassed by so average a performance ? What better way to drive home the nail of inferiority ? What more Pavlovian system of conditioning blacks to dependency than shelling out cash for grades ? Here black students learn to hustle their victimization rather than overcome it , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not all preferential treatment is this insidious , but the same dynamic is always at work when skin color brings entitlement . <p> I think effective racial policies can only come from the sort of white guilt where fear for the self is contained , so that genuine concern can ultimately emerge . The test for this healthy guilt is simply a heartfelt feeling of concern without any compromise of one 's highest values and principles . But how can whites reach this more selfless form of guilt ? I believe the only way is to slacken one 's grip on innocence . Guilt has always been the lazy man 's way to innocence -- I feel guilt because I am innocent , and guilt confirms my innocence . It is the compulsion to think always of ourselves as innocent that binds us to self-preoccupied guilt . Whites in general , and particularly those public and private insitutions ( not necessarily white ) that make racial policy , must not be so preoccupied with their image of innocence or , put another way , their public relations of good intentions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in racial matters where blacks are viewed simply as American citizens who deserve complete fairness , and in some cases developmental assistance , but in no case special entitlements based on color . We need social policies that attack poverty rather than black poverty and that instill those values that make for self-reliance . The white message to blacks must be : America hurt you badly and that is wrong , but entitlements only prolong the hurt , while development overcomes it . <p> Selfish white guilt is really self-importance . It has no humility , and it asks for an unreasonable , egotistical innocence . Nothing diminishes a black more than this sort of guilt in a white , which to my mind amounts to a sort of moral colonialism . We used to say in the 1960s that at least in the South you knew where you stood . I always thought this was a little foolish , since I did n't like where I stood there . But I think one of the things we meant by this -- at the time -- was that the South had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very liberating in an ironical sort of way . It meant there would be no entangling complications with white need . It gave us back ourselves . The selfishly guilty white person is drawn to what blacks least like in themselves -- their suffering , victimization , and dependency . This is no good for anyone -- black or white . <p> By Shelby Steele <p> <p> SHELBY STEELE is an associate professor of English at San Jose State University .

      "##4000162 Section : Life and Letters <p> The prince of wales , in his speeches and book , \" A Vision for Britain , \" attacking modernist architects for buildings they have put up in the post-war years in Britain , has aroused an uproar among architects . One writer in Architectural Review , the leading British architectural journal , even finds the source of the Prince 's taste in the architecture of Nazi Germany . He reproduces some pictures of new housing from a German publicity handout of 1940 , and sure enough they show single-family homes on their own little plots . Because the Nazis preferred single-family houses to apartment-home blocks , he finds a \" precedent for the Prince . \" Of course we find the same preference in Pare Lorentz 's famous movie \" The City , \" made for the New York World 's Fair in 1939 , or in the books and articles of the reformers Clarence Stein and Lewis Mumford , advocating planned communities of low density for families . And these were no Nazis . But architects give the Prince no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the Prince to task for colonialism , racism , and imperialism because he likes classical architecture and would prefer to see more classical elements in contemporary building . In this storm of denunciation , the Prince can only find satisfaction in the fact that the ordinary people seem to agree with him , and that his critics are hysterical . <p> Which raises a paradox : How is it possible that modernist architecture , which began with deep social concerns , and one of whose themes was proper housing for workers to improve their lot , now requires an elitist defense , arguing that only properly qualified , professionally trained experts should discuss and criticize architecture ? How did a socially concerned architecture turn out to be condemned , fifty years later , as soulless , bureaucratic , and inhuman -- a critique that receives wide acceptance by ordinary folk , who have enthusiastically and overwhelmingly applauded the Prince 's attacks on contemporary architecture , and by many architects and planners as well ? <p> It was in the thirties that modern ideas in architecture first began to filter back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans returning from Europe began to bring us news of the modern movement . Some of them were mostly interested in the new , stripped down , unornamented , \" functional \" aesthetic forms , but others were more interested in housing for workers . Catherine Bauer 's \" Modern Housing \" had a great influence on concerned architects , on planners , and on the early public housing movement . She brought back pictures of the new housing being built in Europe by socialist or socially concerned governments . We looked at the pictures with admiration . Instead of the messy working-class districts we knew in American cities , with their crowded buildings built right up in a wall against the streets , with their mixture of housing and stores and pushcarts and signs , with their sidewalks crowded with pedestrians and horses -- there were not many cars in poor areas then -- we saw simple blocks of buildings , in modern styles , oriented to catch the sun , with ample space around each block . <p> Yet today these once-admired building blocks for workers from Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing when or under what regime they were built , most people would prefer those individual homes , shown in the Nazi publicity pamphlet . And many architects would agree . Moshe Safdie , in his book \" Form and Purpose , \" shows pictures of Israeli apartment complexes on the hills around Jerusalem , built under a social democratic government . And he contrasts them unfavorably with Arab housing built without benefit of modernism , or government concern for the poor , or housing laws that guarantee subsidized and modern dwelling units to the poor . In other words , the product of architectural concern for the working classes does n't evoke much admiration today . <p> What seemed in the 1930s and early post-World War II decades to be responsive to social needs -- and indeed was responsive to social needs as far as architects and planners and socially minded governments could discern them at the time -- now seems to us inhumane , soulless , bureaucratic . It is a very upsetting development , if we are concerned that architects take more account of social considerations , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially minded now appears to us pretty poor stuff . Were we wrong then about what was good housing for the poor , and are we right now ? And if our tastes have changed so radically , is it possible that they will change again and that we were right then and are wrong now ? <p> Consider a concrete example of how our tastes and judgments about housing for the poor have changed since the thirties . There is an aerial photograph , much reproduced in reformist books on housing and urbanism , of one of our first housing projects , set in the midst of a sea of slums and tenements in Brooklyn . We see from the air the endless grid of streets , lined with unbroken housing . We can see in the middle of each block , if we look closely , something rather fuzzy -- the backyards behind the tenements of each block . In the middle of the photograph a dozen blocks have been cleared away , obliterating tenements and streets , and set on this white and empty site are lined up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street grid -- as if to remind us that the original street grid was set down by soulless , market-minded surveyors . These new houses for the workers are sited scientifically to catch the sun , or for some other good reason that caused their designers to ignore the original street grid . Around the buildings is an expanse of empty land , which will be dedicated to playgrounds and greenery . I recall , as a social-minded , and socialist , youth , looking at this picture , proud at what had been done , worried about how long it would take to clear away the surrounding sea of slums . <p> When that photograph was first published , the tenements represented the terrible past , the housing project the future . We all know what housing projects represent to us today . Those older buildings , if they have survived , are now often more desirable not only to poor people , but to middle-class people , too . <p> What explains this upsetting reversal of taste ? Do we deal with simple designers ' idiosyncrasies , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brownstones of New York -- properly remodeled of course -- to the housing that was built as part of a great social experiment ? That social experiment incorporated -- to the extent this could be done in the practical world of bureaucrats and financial limitations -- the thinking of socially concerned architects and planners . Is it that we simply and irrationally love strong cornices , stoops , columns , heavy lintels , strongly marked sills , the occasional decoration that graced even the workers ' housing of the early twentieth century ? <p> If that explains the reversal of taste , it would be irresponsible for us to prefer the old . But it turns out that many of the people for whom the subsidized public housing with plenty of open space was built also prefer the old . Now we must avoid the mistake of explaining people 's preferences for one kind of housing or another only because of differences in design . People with few choices do n't decide on the basis of design . If we were to ask them , they might say the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delinquent families , or that they ca n't live near their mothers , or they would give some other reason that relates to the social composition of the project or the bureaucratic rules under which it operates . Or if they prefer the project -- and many do -- we might find out that it 's because it is comparatively so cheap because of its subsidies , and not because of its design and more spacious surroundings . <p> Design is n't everything . But design does play a role , not only in the distaste of present-day designers and architects and planners for the results of the socially concerned architects and planners of the past , but in the preferences of the people with limited choices who reject or accept them today . <p> And so we have our problem : Why is it that the sophisticated intelligence of socially minded architects did n't produce satisfactory environments for those with the least choice ? Even worse : Why is it , as my example suggests , that environments built by commercial builders , trying simply to make a buck as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environments in their appeal to ordinary people ? Now here is something one has to ponder . It is all too easy to understand why the environments created by anonymous architects on Greek islands , in Italian hill towns , in Moroccan cities , are so much more attractive to architects and designers today than what either sophisticated modernists or post-modernists do . That problem is a familiar one , and we have answers that are more or less satisfactory . The town grew organically over time : in one traditional style ; with one major traditional building material ; it enclosed a life defined by a traditional culture . What resulted impresses all architects and designers , of whatever persuasion . In years of leafing through architectural books and magazines , I have never yet seen a picture of one of these Mediterranean urban environments that was used to illustrate a bad environment . Every architect or designer loves them . It is only reformers who are unsophisticated as designers , generally native , who want to sweep them away because of crowding , or dirt , or limited air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building blocks that have become the uniform residence of people all over the world . <p> So we understand well enough why these environments have become so attractive to us . We know why , or can guess why , even the modern displaced Arab , who does know about other ways of building , who can use a variety of materials , who has to build his housing fast rather than over centuries , and who may want to accommodate cars , seems to build a better environment , according to Moshe Safdie , than the Israeli government agencies , with their advanced Western-trained architects and designers , modern standards , up-to-dateness in all respects . <p> For an architect to lose out to the Arab -- or any other traditional builder of the vernacular housing of a traditional culture -- in the way of producing good housing is not so devastating : after all , we are up against all that traditional wisdom , developed over the ages . But to lose out to the commercial builder is another matter , and one that can not make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial builder beats out the architect-designer . <p> The question is why , and I suspect the answers will teach us more than we can learn from the Mediterranean village or the other wonderful works of the vernacular builder . <p> Consider two further examples of this competition between the commercial builder with no higher ambition than to produce what will sell or rent and the sophisticated architect-designer . The first comes from England , and it is the case of the town of Sunderland , a shipbuilding and coal-mining town , fallen on hard times for some decades , in which old housing has been cleared away for new development in the decades since World War II . England , we should recall , stood in the first few decades after the war at the forefront of planning internationally , and at the forefront of Europe in the provision of good housing for the working classes . It was a Mecca for anyone interested in good planning and in sensible replacement of housing stock . The case of Sunderland has been described in a fascinating book by Norman Dennis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , went first , and there seems to have been little opposition to clearing it -- after all , all those who lost their housing were guaranteed new , well-subsidized , modern housing . By 1965 , the worst of the slums had been cleared , but central government money was still available for going further , and planners selected the areas -- by their standards -- that should be leveled , with the people rehoused in new modern flats . By this time , the resistance was severe . Why ? Consider the houses that were coming down , to be replaced by modern flats . They are typical of the row houses for workers of the dreary industrial towns of England . These \" cottages , \" as they were called in Sunderland , were built for the working class by unnamed builders one hundred years ago . Many were rented , but most were by this time owned by their inhabitants . The houses sit directly on the sidewalk . There are no trees on the street . There is no front yard . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , and if there 's a second , as some have , two more windows . There is a tiny backyard with a brick outhouse . What could possess people to prefer these anonymous and styleless dwellings to new flats , and ones heavily subsidized to boot ? But if one looks more closely , one sees that one facade has been stuccoed , another left in brick . One entry has a flat top , another an arched one . Some windows have heavily marked lintels , top and bottom . Others have the lintels stuccoed over . At the end of one block , in a unit identical to the others , is the Gardener 's Arms , a pub . <p> We can understand some of the reasons why people preferred to stay , and some of them have nothing to do with architects or designers . They had lived there a long time . They had their friends there . They had their local stores to shop in , their churches and chapels . All this would be hard to replace in the new areas where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of town , with plenty of buses . In the new outlying areas to which they would have to move , there were fewer buses , running infrequently . And even though I imagine none of us would think much of Sunderland on a Saturday night , a center is still a center , for convenience , for liveliness . Many of them owned their own cottages -- and could do with them what they liked , and arrange them to their taste . They were no longer crowded . But after all this , the striking thing is that housing built with ostensibly no attention to personal taste and desire , thrown up to cover the most land and make the most money , using the materials and technology of the 1870s , was considered superior by many of those living in them to the new flats designed by the best planning authorities using good architects . Imagine what the cooking , bathing , and toileting facilities of such cottages were . The w.c. ' s were typically out in the backyard , and the cottages had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek isles or the Italian hill towns -- it was ordinary working-class , uninspired housing , and yet the residents preferred it . <p> Could they have been provided with something that gave them the advantages of the old houses they had , and which eliminated the very striking disadvantages ? Very likely . But we have some evidence that a taste for a proper modern style on the part of the architects made a close replacement impossible . The local authorities were committed to flats : <p> In discussing with the relevant officers the reasons for choosing flats as a form of development in Sunderland the interviewer was told that \" high-rise blocks are essential to the skyline of the town . \" Seven blocks of 16-storied flats were built at Gilley Law , on the outskirts of the town , as a result of an \" aesthetic choice . \" <p> The mind boggles at the thought of sixteen-story apartment houses in Sunderland , where the top density of the area to be cleared ( two-story houses ) was only sixty-eight rooms per acre . Most of the rehousing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the residents still opposed that . <p> So we can well understand why many of the people of Sunderland preferred to stay in their old houses and their old neighborhoods . They even argued their disadvantages were advantages . The fact that the main window was right on the pavement , they said , meant more \" privacy . \" \" Passers-by do n't get the chance to look in -- they are past too quickly . \" <p> We understand that everyone prefers a place of his own , with his own front and backyard . We also understand that when we build at the high densities of large cities not everyone can have them . But consider a dense city , such as Manhattan . We find that even the commercially built housing of New York City , that would appear on the face of it much less desirable than the Sunderland cottages , also had virtues that new housing could not provide . <p> The plan for Manhattan has been denounced by every sophisticated planner . As Lewis Mumford , and others , argued , the checkerboard plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avenues coming at fixed intervals , each block was the same size , and each could be reduced to the same property modules for easy marketing -- no odd-sized lots , and modules could be cumulated for larger property sizes . And so the peculiar Manhattan block , with its long and narrow street side , its short side on a wide avenue , broken into **26;54;TOOLONG building lots . The plan required no sophistication -- no diagonal streets , no adaptation to topography . And it turned out utilizing it for commercial building required no sophistication either . The brownstone town house was invented for the upper middle classes , and put up by the thousands ; the tenement and other apartment houses were invented for the working classes , and put up by the thousands . For grandeur , a few lots were put together for the town houses of Fifth Avenue , and later for huge apartment houses , a half-block or block in size , on Park Avenue and on other avenues . <p> No one has ever had a good word for this non-design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing it down . Then we discovered that the brownstone provided wonderful living quarters , even when it was broken down to house a half-dozen or more families ; that the tenements , once the severe overcrowding was overcome -- that is generally the single most serious problem in housing for the poor -- also provided good living space . For a child growing up in these tenements , there was really no serious problem except crowding . The street side of the tenement provided life , variety , play spaces around stoops , even play spaces in the streets , before the traffic became heavy . Marbles could be rolled along the curbside -- I was always mystified at how kids could play marbles without a convenient curb along which to roll them . On the other side of the house were the quiet backyards . They even had trees . Despite the crowding in the tenements , these backyards , completely surrounded by buildings that by law could not occupy the entire building space , and cut off on all sides from street and avenue , were quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the noise of Manhattan -- if , that is , people are not playing their radios . <p> Two kinds of structure have replaced them , insofar as they have been replaced for residential purposes rather than commercial and business purposes : we have public housing projects , built tall to reserve the largest amount of space for greenery and parking and to open up the apartments to more light and air ; and more crowded , unsubsidized apartment houses , built on a huge scale compared to the old brownstones and tenements , on large plots . The former reflect public decisions , partially unconstrained by market costs ; the latter represent market decisions under a variety of constraints that are more severe than those that limited the earlier buildings . Both , I would argue , have provided worse living quarters than were provided earlier . <p> The story I have told is not one confined to New York City . Herbert Gans , in his well-known book \" The Urban Villagers , \" describes the tenements of the West End of Boston , the area adjacent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be replaced by tall , modern apartment houses . The houses of the West End were quite similar to those in the tenement areas of New York , except that the buildings were somewhat lower and smaller . If we look at the pictures in \" The Urban Villagers , \" we find units not very different from Little Italy in New York or the West Village tenements . Again , once the overcrowding of poverty was overcome , the people living there found their condition perfectly satisfactory -- indeed , more than satisfactory . They resisted fiercely being driven out of their homes for new development for others . <p> Of course their satisfaction -- as is the satisfaction of the brownstone and tenement dwellers of New York -- was not provided only or perhaps not even primarily by the design of their houses . One must take into account that they had lived there a long time and had their shopping places and churches and friends and relatives nearby . They also paid low rents for their older quarters . But I would insist that there were aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactions : they had one or three neighbors on an entry , rather than twenty or thirty ; they were closer to the ground , in three- , four- , and five-story buildings , and could watch their children at play , or call to them ; they had enclosed semi-private open space -- not in this case for them individually , of course , but still space in the backyards that provided a different and quiet experience -- as well as public space , which the towers-in-a-park design of public housing , as well as unsubsidized apartment towers , could not provide . <p> The point is not to praise the commercially minded builder , who is of course concerned with cutting costs to the bone and getting the best return on his money . It is rather to force us to ponder the comparison between thoughtlessness and sophistication in design at the point where it should most favor the sophisticated ; to consider why private building for the incredibly poor workers of the past was superior to the public building of our more prosperous societies for more prosperous people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction seem to have been ignored by the sophisticated . They were cavalier about the characteristics and satisfactions of old neighborhoods . They were all too ready to wipe away what existed and start with a clean slate -- many preferred to do this and objected to the costs of retaining some of the old and integrating it with the new . They were attached to forms , whether the high tower or the flats that look like factories or machines for living . It has been , it is my impression , not architects but their critics -- as well as resisting homeowners , tenants , and residents of old areas -- who have limited mass clearance and have sparked as much rehabilitation as we have . It was not the architects who advocated rehabilitation , though to my mind rehabilitation offers designers wonderful opportunities . <p> Most significantly , designers failed to explore just what it is people find attractive in areas and buildings for whose design characteristics not much if anything can be said . How often have we seen those pictures of endless Levittowns , little houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons to avoid ? And how often have we contrasted them -- to their disadvantage -- with gleaming visions of great towers ? Let us put to one side for a moment the economic arguments that require density ; and let us recognize that very often the density and overall cost of single-family homes packed closely , or low-lying apartments , would compare favorably with twenty-story apartment towers . I will not enter into the argument of comparative costs , which is in any case complicated , but we all know that studies have shown that the advantages are not always in one direction , and that often \" an aesthetic choice \" -- to quote from the Sunderland investigation -- a choice by either public authorities , designers , or commercial builders , dictates height . <p> So let us go back to the contrast without worrying about the economics : Levittown on one side ; and on the other striking apartment towers , and they have recently been striking indeed -- serpentine on the outskirts of Paris , inverted pyramids on the outskirts of Rome , or spiky concentrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the architect or critic may have of the latter , they are at least \" interesting . \" But let us look at the contrast ten or twenty years after they are completed . In Levittown the trees have grown ; various types of fences wall in back and front yards ; some buildings sprout additions on top , some on the side ; with the children gone , rooms are being remodeled from bedrooms to libraries , and so on and so on . The apartment towers one suspects show no such opportunities for change . How could they , since their residents have so little power over their environment ? The trees will grow , and the landscaping perhaps improve -- if there 's money for it , but there wo n't be much if people do n't see it as theirs . <p> Finally , am I saying the architect ca n't beat Levittown , and that there is nothing to his skill , his training , his taste , his occasional genius , that makes up for the ordinary crass effort to provide what people want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford ? No , I would not say that , but rather that the architect has not tried hard enough to find out what people liked , and like , whether in old slums or new developments , and to see what his skills could do to satisfy , build on , and improve upon that , even though there are some remarkable and admirable exceptions . I admit it is more fun to explore Greek islands and Italian hill towns than American slums and suburbs , but there is as much to learn in the latter as the former . <p> Wherever social scientists examine these things , they find a taste that architects on the whole do not find it interesting to satisfy , a taste for the low-rise , the small scale , the unit that gives some privacy , some control , some access to the ground , a small piece of land wholly under one 's control . I am not of course describing a universal taste . But for people raising children -- and indeed many others -- it is a near universal taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reason to think that it is necessary or desirable that people be educated against that taste , and develop a new taste for a larger , or gargantuan scale . On occasion , conditions seem to make what most people want impossible , particularly in the very largest cities . New tastes are developed , and people find it is possible to adapt to tall blocks and greater density -- many have , and many more will have to . Even when we adapt to such necessities there are things to learn from how people live and use space that we have not yet learned . Nor am I convinced that the exigencies of finances or the requirements of ordinances and laws will make it impossible to provide environments people find more satisfactory . <p> The sociologist considering what people like and what they find satisfactory is likely to appear a real spoilsport to architects and designers , a rather glum soul who first tells us that they prefer their old buildings -- any old buildings -- to new ones , and secondly that even when you drive them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice in something new , it tends to be a homey , fussy , dowdy single-family house they prefer , rather than sparkling towers of interesting shapes or modernist structures of glass and aluminum . After all , architects and designers want to soar , both to build and design great things , new and not yet imagined things , and are we to confine them by what the ordinary man prefers and insists upon ? <p> Well , to begin with , in a modern consumer society , the ordinary man will eventually get what he wants -- unless it is being provided by central government , heavily subsidized , and being given to him whether he wants it or not , as in the case of council housing blocks in England or public housing in the United States . In both countries , we are now dynamiting the tall blocks that were once the admired model for family housing only twenty or thirty years ago . But second , the architect and designer can still soar , because there are many more structures in the world than those required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , historically the architect and designer has only soared when he built for the rich , for the state , for the church . He still can -- if these clients will let him -- and in addition he now has a very substantial client who wants things big and striking , the corporation rearing its towers . Not that he should or could ignore what people want in working environments , or convening environments , or even worshipping environments , but everyone accepts the symbolic role of such structures , and one can break out without the need for an economical accommodation of needs . <p> And , of course , there are other ways of soaring , of building big -- and once again one thinks of the Greek isles and Italian hill towns and Moroccan cities , in which an organized approach to building , added to bit by bit over time , has created environments to which people cling , and which delight the eyes and souls of architects and designers . But if we are to expect the accumulation of small-scale environments -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of the small scale -- to cumulate into grand structures and environments , we probably need more changes in our society than I can envisage . Christopher Alexander and his associates have made a heroic effort to establish such a way of building for our day , in which more or less anonymous action produces large and substantial effects , and it is an effort that must arouse our sympathy and awe , even if we recognize its problems . Perhaps there is still a way for the architect , without becoming -- as so many modern form-makers have insisted -- the dictator of an environment to provide a process , a set of tools , a mechanism whereby individual action can cumulate to great harmonious wholes . But the only way of doing that , in the absence of dictators , is through a steady and dedicated concern with how people live , what they want , what they find desirable and attractive , and what they find troublesome and inconvenient . This has to be done before one builds , while one builds , after one builds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it delightful to put everyone into a great triangle , or obelisk , or a sphere ? has to collapse under this investigation -- so be it . We can always put it in drawings . <p> Little by little , is , I suspect , in the modern world , the answer , not only in building , but in public policy , where many great schemes have come crashing down . <p> Pondering his study of Sunderland , which he began with the easy optimistic belief that well-trained planners and designers know best , Norman Dennis was driven to another conclusion . He writes : <p> As Edmund Burke said in another connection , the high level of satisfaction in areas like the ones scheduled to be torn down is the result of a choice not of one day or one set of people . . . . It is made by the peculiar circumstances , occasion , tempers , dispositions and moral , civil , and social habitudes of the people which disclose themselves only in a long period of time . <p> And again and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wisdom , when we work only on inanimate matter , surely they become part of duty too , when the subject of our demolition and construction is not bricks and timber , but sentient being . The true lawgiver \" -- and I would add , the architect and designer too -- \" ought to love and respect his kind , and to fear himself . \" <p> It is this point of view , not lack of architectural expertise , that connects the Prince with the ordinary people , and divides him from his architect critics . <p> By Nathan Glazer <p> <p> NATHAN GLAZER is professor of education and sociology at Harvard University and co-editor of \" The Public Interest . \" He edited , with Mark Lilla , \" The Public Face of Architecture : Civic Culture and Public Spaces . \" His most recent book is \" The Limits of Social Policy . \" <p> \n",
